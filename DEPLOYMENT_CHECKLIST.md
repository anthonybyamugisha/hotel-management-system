# Hotel Management Application Deployment Checklist

## 1. Verify Render Dashboard Configuration

### Environment Variables
Make sure these environment variables are set in your Render dashboard:
- `SECRET_KEY` - Should be automatically generated by Render
- `DEBUG` - Should be set to `False` for production
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` - Should include your Render domain: `hotel-management-system-igsf.onrender.com`

### Database Connection
- Verify that your database service is properly linked to your web service
- Check that the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is automatically set by Render

## 2. Check Render Build Logs

1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Click on your web service
3. Check the "Logs" tab during build and deploy
4. Look for any error messages during:
   - Build process
   - Dependency installation
   - Static file collection
   - Application startup

## 3. Common Issues and Solutions

### Database Migration Issues
If your application is failing due to database issues:
1. SSH into your Render instance (if possible)
2. Run migrations manually:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

### Static Files Issues
If CSS/styles are not loading:
1. Ensure `collectstatic` runs during build
2. Check that `STATIC_ROOT` is set correctly in settings.py
3. Verify WhiteNoise is configured properly

### Database Connection Issues
If you're getting database connection errors:
1. Check that your database service is running
2. Verify the DATABASE_URL is correctly formatted
3. Ensure your database has the correct schema/tables

## 4. Testing Your Deployment

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Visit your application URL: https://hotel-management-system-igsf.onrender.com
2. Check if the home page loads
3. Navigate to reports and dashboard pages
4. Verify that charts are displaying data
5. Check that traditional reports show data

### Debugging Commands
Run these commands in your Render console if possible:
```bash
# Check if Django can be imported
python -c "import django; print(django.get_version())"

# Check database connection
python manage.py dbshell

# Check if all migrations have been applied
python manage.py showmigrations

# Collect static files (if not done during build)
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

## 5. Render-Specific Configuration

### Your render.yaml Configuration
Your current configuration looks correct:
```yaml
databases:
  - name: hotel-management-db
    databaseName: hotelmanagementdb
    user: hoteluser
    plan: free

services:
  - type: web
    name: hotel-management
    runtime: python
    plan: free
    buildCommand: "./setup.sh"
    startCommand: "gunicorn hotel_management.wsgi:application"
    envVars:
      - key: DATABASE_URL
        fromDatabase:
          name: hotel-management-db
          property: connectionString
      - key: SECRET_KEY
        generateValue: true
      - key: WEB_CONCURRENCY
        value: 4
      - key: DEBUG
        value: False
```

### Your setup.sh Script
Your setup script should handle dependencies and static files:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Collect static files
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

echo "Setup completed successfully!"
```

## 6. Troubleshooting Steps

### If the Application Doesn't Start
1. Check Render logs for startup errors
2. Verify that your startCommand is correct: `gunicorn hotel_management.wsgi:application`
3. Ensure all required packages are in requirements.txt

### If Pages Load but Show Errors
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check browser network tab for failed requests
3. Look for 500 server errors in the network tab

### If Database Queries Fail
1. Verify your SQL files are correctly formatted
2. Check that your database tables exist and have data
3. Ensure column names in your views.py match your SQL query results

## 7. Next Steps

1. Check your Render logs to identify the specific error
2. If you can't access logs, try redeploying with manual deployment
3. Consider adding more detailed error logging to your views
4. Test database connectivity with a simple test view

## 8. Contact Support

If you're still having issues:
1. Save your Render logs
2. Document the specific error messages
3. Check Render's status page for any ongoing issues
4. Contact Render support with detailed information
