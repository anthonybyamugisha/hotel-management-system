- **Hotels and Staff**: Detailed information about hotels and their staff members

### 3. Analytics Dashboard
Interactive visualizations using Chart.js:
- **Monthly Revenue Trend**: Line chart showing revenue over time
- **Hotel Occupancy Rates**: Bar chart comparing occupancy across hotels
- **Room Type Distribution**: Pie chart showing room inventory distribution
- **Staff Performance**: Horizontal bar chart of department performance scores

### 4. Database Management
